# My philosophy - The Sword, The Shield, The Armour

In my philosophy, discipline is the most important factor in achieving any kind of objective.

Discipline is the difference between passing and failing, succeeding and excelling, merely existing and living free.

It provides cold, relentless power to overcome obstacles and solve problems of any kind.

## Discipline

Discipline is the sword, and with this sword you can fell any problem, any issue, and achieve greatness.

Like excalibur, wielding this weapon will make you king of your own existence.

But heavy lies the crown, make no mistake.

Truly internalizing that you can do anything you set your mind to imparts the realisation that anything you do not accomplish is your own fault.

In this worldview, there is nobody, nothing else to blame, except your own lack of willpower.

Many people refuse to pick up the sword of discipline because this burden of responsability is too great, and the implications it leads too are too damaging to their ego.

If I can be 250lb of pure muscle with just discipline, why aren't I? If I can become an expert software engineer, or write a book, or learn to play piano, why don't I? 

## Excuses

Most will refuse to believe these things are possible. They will hide their ego behind the shield of excuses. 

Excuses protect us from the realization that we are to blame for our own failings. They protect us against the cognitive dissonance that arises when we aknowledge we arent what we want to be, where we want to be, who we want to be.

The shield is effective. This is why many indulge in its use. 

But you cannot use the sword while cowaring behind the shield.

And you cannot defeat your problems without the sword. The shield alone will keep you exactly where you are.

The shield is enemy of progress. 

You must step out from behind the protection of excuses, grasp the sword with both hands, and attack. 

There is another way to protect yourself from weight of responsability that comes from wielding the incredible power of discipline.

## Accountability. 

Unlike excuses, Accountability is not a shield, rather, it is your armour. 

It will not prevent you using the sword.

Accountability is accepting the result of your choices. At its core, it is honesty, transparency, purity of spirit.

It is the opposite of excuses, but it provides the same benefit.

Accountability will protect your ego from the crushing weight of discipline. 

You are not 250lb of pure muscle because you have not chosen to put the effort to be that, yet. 

You are not the software engineer, because you havent chosen to be that, yet.

You havent written the book, or learnt the piano, because you have never truly tried. Not yet. 

And maybe you never will. Thats fine. This is the key.

As long as you are accountable to yourself that the decision is YOURS. There are no external factors preventing you from picking up the weights at the gym. Or learning piano, or writting the book.

Lack of time? sleep less. Lack of energy? Make better habits. Eat better, go out less, play less video games, watch less TV. The spiderweb of decisions all fall back on your decisions in the end of the day.

Accepting this is tough, its heavy, but most importantly, it is EMPOWERING. YOU ARE IN CONTROL!

And if you are OK with these decisions, then accountability will protect you. It will make you understand that you are living an experience that is the sum your choices.

It will enable you to aknowledge the power that discipline can bring you, without contradicting your belief that you can achieve anything you want.

Accountability says, thats ok, I chose to not try as hard as possible and thus, I accept the outcome. But I know deep down that with discipline, I could have done better.

In my opinion, the combination of Discipline and Accountability are the key to healthy self-actualization and growth. They are core components of being a self determining, efficient, successful person.

Drop the shield, adone the armour, and pull the sword from the stone my friend.
