In the world of offensive security, drivers are incredibly powerful. Mastering their usage and exploitation can open a wealth of options to a penetration testers.
But this topic can seem challenging and even esoteric to those less familiar with low-level programming or the Windows operating system in general.
For this reason, I've decided to prepare this article which will delve into the subject from an offensive security perspective. 
Hopefully, you may learn something about the process of leveraging these programs to achieve results in your engagements.
In this article, I will discuss what drivers are and why they are interesting to hackers. We will go over how a vulnerable driver is identified, reverse-engineered,
and ultimately leveraged by an attacker to perform malicious actions. Finally, we will explore the potential usecases of such vulnerable drivers and how they can 
be used by penetration testers and red team operatives to bypass next-generation antivirus and EDR products.
